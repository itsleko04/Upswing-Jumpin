# Upswing Jumpin'
## Hello!
We are a team of two people from Russia. The project was implemented as part of a progress review organized by our place of study – something like a game jam, but with the goal of simply showcasing the knowledge we’ve gained. We both love rhythm games, so the choice quickly fell on this genre. Unfortunately, the grading criteria limited our choice of ideas, so we decided to settle on a GD clone. <br/> 
We hope you enjoy it!
